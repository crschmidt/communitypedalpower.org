Community Pedal Power is a joint effort among bike advocates in the 
Cambridge/Somerville area. Our goal is to get more folks on bikes
throughout the community. Through test rides and bike loans, group rides
to explore infrastructure, and technical investment in helping folks get the
best biking experience for their dollar, we're interested in any ways 
that we can help folks see bikes as a core part of their transportation.

The organization was founded by Paul Morgan, founder of Family Bike Ride;
Christopher Schmidt, founder of the Camberville E-Bike Lending Library,
and Nathan Faber, a community advocate who helped put dozens of families on
cargo bikes in 2023.

The organization is a non-profit host for a number of activities, enabling
tax-deductible donations to support these cycling efforts.
