For all Tern owners: please ensure that you [register for Tern care](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/support/registration) using your Service Tag before someone else does, document the Frame Number for theft purposes, NOT the Service Tag number. Register your bikes on [BikeIndex](https://bikeindex.org/) today, using the Frame Number. If your bike is stolen or someone you know, make sure it is registered on BikeIndex promptly.

You have two unique numbers on your bike, one is a "Service Tag" and one is a "Frame number". The Service tag is on a QR code sticker and may not survive very long on your bike. The "Frame Number" is the one you will want to document if it is ever stolen; this number can not be removed or faked, as it is engraved into the frame.

Using the Service Tag, you can register your bike with Tern. Once you register, nobody else can register that same Service Tag or easily pull information using it. Using this Service Tag, the Tern portal will provide the frame number and potentially the key numbers. You do not want a third party to register for you and discover your key numbers - so make sure you register before anyone else does. You also get an extended warranty on your frame, but that isn't what this post is about.

Additionally, if your bike is stolen and needs to be identified, you want to have the Frame Number documented, not the Service Tag (or both). The Service Tag can be removed, after which the only easy identification is the Frame Number, it is stamped into the frame. When you register on BikeIndex and with the police, either provide both numbers or provide the Frame Number.

Additionally, if your bike is ever stolen or someone you know, you must register it on BikeIndex immediately. It is nearly the only hope of you ever being reunited with your bike. We have not yet had any success with bikes recovered from police databases, but we have regularly helped people recover bikes using BikeIndex registrations. Spread this information far and wide.

You can read more about these numbers on the [Tern website](https://www.ternbicycles.com/en/support/kb/348433/where-my-bike-number).
