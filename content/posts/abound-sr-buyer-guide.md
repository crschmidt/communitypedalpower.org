# Aventon Abound SR: What to Buy & Where

Whether you're gearing up for daily rides, errands, or hauling your kiddo, here's a solid list of what to buy *with your bike*, what to get as add-ons (from Community Pedal Power, or anywhere similar), and how to make the Abound SR work well in winter.

Note that the Abound SR is **not compatible with the Storm Box**; additionally, it is difficult to install a Yepp seat and the captain's chair bars at the same time due to heel-strike on the Yepp footrests. Given the small difference in price between the Abound LR and the Abound SR, if your child is younger, you may want to consider purchasing the more flexible [Abound LR](/blog/2025/09/aventon-abound-lr-what-to-buy-where/) instead.

## What to Buy from the Bike Shop

These are the items you should get *with* your Aventon Abound SR (or order through your dealer), so that setup is clean and compatible from the start.

| Item | Why It’s Important | Price* |
|---|---|---|
| **[Aventon Abound SR (bike itself)](https://www.aventon.com/products/abound-sr-ebike)** | The base platform: long rear rack, robust 750 W motor, good payload, built-in security features, etc. | **$1,899** |
| **[Front “Pizza” Rack](https://www.aventon.com/products/aventon-pizza-front-rack-abound-sr-abound-lr)** | A flat front platform for small loads up front. This will be combined with a milk crate to create storage space in the front of the bike. | **$72.99** |

| **[Yepp Maxi 2 or Yepp Nexxt Maxi 2 child seat](https://www.aventon.com/products/thule-yepp-nexxt-2-maxi-rack-mount-child-seat)** | Solid rear seat for a child: safe, padded, mounts well to the long rack with the proper hardware. Needed for carrying children under 4 years old. Note that this does not work well with the Captain's Chair, so if your child is younger, you may not want to purchase the Captain's Chair right away. | **$259.95** |
| **[Abound SR Footpegs](https://www.aventon.com/products/aventon-pegs-abound-sr)** | Abound SR footpegs, for adult or kids feet to sit on in the rear. | $23.99 |
| **[Aventon Dropper Seatpost](https://www.aventon.com/products/replacement-seatpost?variant=43226450559171)** | For taller riders, add the "Aventon External Dropper Seatpost 30.9mm 440mm length" to swap your default seatpost to a taller one. | **$42.99** |

## Putting It All Together: Sample Totals & Considerations

Here’s a rough total cost of buying everything listed above:

- Bike + front pizza rack + rear carrier kit + Yepp seat =  
    $1,899 + $72.99 + $139.99 + $259.95 + $23.99 = **≈ $2,396**
- Add-ons from CPP = $25 + $175 + $20 = **$220**
- Dropper Seatpost, Cell Phone Mount: **$61**   
- Winter kit (Storm Shield Mini) = **$240**.

## Where to Buy

For buyers in the Boston area, we recommend one of our local Aventon dealers:

* Landry's: Many locations throughout the Boston area, tends to have bikes in stock, no bike build fee.
* Ride Cafe: Ride Cafe is a small Melrose-based shop that is great for folks in the area.
* Farina's: Farina's in Watertown is a long-time Aventon dealer.

## Final Thoughts

- Buy the essentials with the bike: the bike, cargo racks, and child seat if needed.  
- Then layer in the CPP add-ons for cargo convenience and security.  
- If you plan to ride through winter, invest in the Storm Box & Shield + adapter setup. It makes a big difference in comfort and usability.
