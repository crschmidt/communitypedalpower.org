Over the past few months, several stolen cargo bikes have been successfully recovered — thanks in large part to the incredible vigilance and teamwork of members of the **[Cargo Bikes of Camberville Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1029543797114243)** and volunteers from **Community Pedal Power**.  

While bike theft is unfortunately common, **cargo bikes are often distinctive enough** that when the community acts quickly, there’s a real chance of getting them back.

## How the Recovery Process Works

Community Pedal Power volunteers have been working to spread awareness and create a **rapid response process** for stolen cargo bikes.  
If your cargo bike is stolen, here’s what to do — **in this exact order**.  
*(Speed matters — every hour counts!)*

1. **If you have an AirTag on your bike:** Email **[stolen@communitypedalpower.org](mailto:stolen@communitypedalpower.org)** immediately — *before* attempting to locate the bike yourself.

2. **If you don’t have an AirTag:** Post your bike to **[Bike Index](https://bikeindex.org)** and to the **Cargo Bikes of Camberville** Facebook group right away.  You don’t need your serial number to post — share what you can and update later.

3. **Include a clear, recent photo** of your bike. Visuals help the community spot it faster.

4. **Email** [stolen@communitypedalpower.org](mailto:stolen@communitypedalpower.org) **with your contact information** so volunteers can reach you quickly if someone reports a sighting.

5. **After those steps are complete**, contact the **police** and file an official report.

6. **Gather proof of ownership and any spare keys**, such as those for cafe locks, to make the recovery process smoother if your bike is found.

## Why Acting Fast Matters

**The first 24 hours are crucial.**  
Almost all successful recoveries happen within that window. Once a bike has been missing longer, the odds drop significantly — and in many cases, we simply don’t know where those bikes end up.

Posting promptly to **Bike Index** and **Cargo Bikes of Camberville** ensures more people are keeping eyes out as soon as possible.

## How Everyone Can Help

Even if your bike hasn’t been stolen, you can still play a role in keeping the community safe.  

Keep an eye out for **cargo or e-bikes in unusual places**, such as:  
- A **Tern GSD** charging from a random outlet in a pocket park  
- A **Gazelle** sitting unlocked at a public rack  
- An **Aventon Abound** left on the side of a bike path  
- A **WorkCycles GR8** abandoned on a side street  

Sometimes there’s an innocent reason — a flat tire, a temporary lockup — but often, it’s worth a closer look.  

If you see something that doesn’t feel right and **it’s safe to do so**, take a quick photo and share it with:  
- The **Cargo Bikes of Camberville** group, or  
- **[stolen@communitypedalpower.org](mailto:stolen@communitypedalpower.org)**

## Safety First

**Never directly confront** someone you believe has a stolen bike.  
If you spot a bike that might be stolen:
- Comment on the relevant Facebook post, or  
- Email **[stolen@communitypedalpower.org](mailto:stolen@communitypedalpower.org)**  

We’ve seen situations where people trying to intervene directly were **physically attacked by bike thieves**. No recovery is worth personal injury.  

The best way to help is by **sharing what you see** — that’s how bikes get reunited safely with their owners.

## The Results So Far

Thanks to the **Cargo Bikes of Camberville** community, **Community Pedal Power**, and the support of local shops like **Bicycle Belle**, we’ve helped **reunite nearly a dozen stolen bikes with their owners in just the past two months**.  

That’s a powerful reminder that **community awareness works.**

## A Note on Recoveries

Many people ask what happens during an actual recovery.  
In most cases, once a stolen bike is located:
- The owner calls **911** (or the local police department where the bike is found).  
- When officers arrive, the owner shows proof of ownership (like a serial number).  
- The police approach the person with the bike and usually return it on the spot.  

We’ve had particularly smooth experiences in **Cambridge**, with mixed but improving cooperation in **Somerville** and **Boston**.  

But the real victory happens **long before that** — when someone in the community **spots the missing bike** and reports it.
