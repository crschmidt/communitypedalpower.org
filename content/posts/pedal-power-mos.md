On August 24th, the Museum of Science hosted "[Pedal Power: Celebrating
Community Through Biking](https://www.mos.org/events/pedal-power)". We brought
along bikes, lawn games, and flyers to share with the community about the 
E-Bike Lending Library and Family Bike Ride, two of our ongoing efforts to 
connect the community to more cycling opportunities.

We had conversations with dozens of families, helping them learn more about
the biking resources available in our community, alongside more than a dozen
other organizations advocating for new trails, better infrastructure, and other
great resources for the community.

The event was highlighted in the Boston Globe today: [Rediscovering the joy of biking in Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/31/opinion/rediscovering-joy-biking-boston/) is a lovely editorial cartoon put together by [Sage Strossel](https://www.sagestossel.com/), highlighting the event, including our work with the e-bike library.

Thanks to the [Museum of Science](https://www.mos.org/) and [HUBLUV](https://www.hubluv.org/) for hosting the event, and to Sage for her work in sharing the event with others!
