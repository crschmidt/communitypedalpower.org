To keep biking viable when the weather turns (cold, wind, snow), here are some winter-specific accessories, and how they can be adapted to the Abound LR.

| **[Tern Storm Box](https://store.ternbicycles.com/products/storm-box-for-gsd)** | A weather-protected enclosure / box to shelter kid passengers or cargo from snow / wind. | Can be mounted to the Abound's handrail + long rear rack with an adapter kit. | $250 |

## Putting It All Together: Sample Totals & Considerations

Here’s a rough total cost of buying everything listed above:

- Bike + front pizza rack + rear carrier kit + Yepp seat =  
    $1,999 + $72.99 + $228.99 + $259.95 = **≈ $2,560**
- Add-ons from CPP = $25 + $175 + $20 = **$220**
- Dropper Seatpost, Cell Phone Mount: **$61**   
- Winter kit (Storm Box + Storm Shield + adapter) = **$550**.

## Where to Buy

For buyers in the Boston area, we recommend one of our local Aventon dealers:

* Landry's: Many locations throughout the Boston area, tends to have bikes in stock, no bike build fee.
* Ride Cafe: Ride Cafe is a small Melrose-based shop that is great for folks in the area.
* Farina's: Farina's in Watertown is a long-time Aventon dealer.

## Final Thoughts

- Buy the essentials with the bike: the bike, cargo racks, and child seat if needed.  
- Then layer in the CPP add-ons for cargo convenience and security.  
- If you plan to ride through winter, invest in the Storm Box & Shield + adapter setup. It makes a big difference in comfort and usability.
