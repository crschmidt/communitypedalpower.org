title: Security Offering
---

In order to help with potential recovery of bikes in the community, we are working to help provide users with options for adding trackers to their bikes. All offerings are based on tracking devices using the Apple Find My network, so require the owner to have access to an iOS device in order to perform tracking. 

For Android users, we recommend having a friend add the tags for you and assist when needed. The Apple Find My network is the only existing network with enough reach to be effective.

We have two different offerings, depending on the level of security you are looking for.

## Basic Tracking

Recommended for any bike.

We will give you a new-in-the-box tracker compatible with the Apple Find My network, and a compatible mounting device: Either a bell, a water bottle mount holder, or a sticker mount, your choice. Items will be provided for unattended pickup, and you will set up and install the tracking device on your own.

- [Tracker \+ Sticker mount cost](https://community-pedal-power.square.site/product/tracker-sticker-mount/1): $10  
- [Tracker \+ Water Bottle mount](https://community-pedal-power.square.site/product/tracker-bottle-cage-mount/3) cost: $15  
- [Tracker \+ Bell](https://community-pedal-power.square.site/product/tracker-bell-mount/2) cost: $15

If you would like to purchase one additional tracker with your purchase (e.g. so you can hide an additional tracker on the bike), add an extra $5.

## Advanced Security Package Offering

Recommended for higher-cost e-bikes and cargo bikes.

The security package offering is a targeted package for higher end / higher cost bikes. We will work with you to install two specially designed Apple Find My compatible trackers, adapted to be more difficult for thieves to find or remove. This will include an in-person installation visit, where we will set up and install the trackers with you, as well as helping you register your bike on BikeIndex. This bundle includes:

- Two Apple Find My compatible trackers, specialized to be more difficult for thieves to find and remove.  
- Package of stickers to indicate that your bike has trackers installed  
- BikeIndex QR code sticker, to further dissuade thieves, and help increase the chance of recovery.  
- Additional security measure that will be disclosed in person

If your trackers fail for some reason, this package includes free replacement for the first 12 months.

Cost: $100
