We stock a number of items to help support the local community, aiming to help
folks save money or time in buying critical accessories for your biking needs.
Buying these items helps support Community Pedal Power, including Family Bike
Ride and the E-Bike Lending Library.

# Litelok X1

The Litelok X1 is an angle grinder resistant lock that we recommend for folks
who regularly lock bikes in shared spaces, such as an apartment building
parking garage.
