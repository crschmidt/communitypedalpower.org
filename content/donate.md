title: Donate to Community Pedal Power!
---

Community Pedal Power is a 501c3 non-profit that supports community cycling
efforts in the Somerville + Cambridge area. Donations help support projects
like the Camberville E-Bike Lending Library, Family Bike Ride, and Cargo Bike
Test Ride events.

In 2023, these events helped dozens of families transition from driving to
biking for more trips, and in 2024, we're hoping to do even more: bringing
more rides from Family Bike Ride, expanding the E-Bike Lending Library, and
helping support other programs to expand cycling in the community.
